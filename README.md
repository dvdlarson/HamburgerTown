# hamburgerTown
Week 13 homework assignment for U of A coding bootcamp

app is deployed at heroku : <a href="https://pacific-meadow-99774.herokuapp.com/">Click Here To Go to Hamburger Town</a>

This app allows the user to select a hamburger from a list of available burgers and click a button to 'eat' it.
Doing so will move the burger from the available column to the 'burgers eaten' column.
Users can also input the name of a new burger to add to the list.

This app employs Sequelize, MySql, Express, and Body-Parser.

Further enhancements include - 
<ul>
  <li>conditional button with changing text to either eat or 'prepare again' to move the burger back to the uneaten side.<li>
  <li>Audio of Homer Simpson saying 'Mmmmm Burger'. I added this, but could not get the code to continue after the media event. <li>
